# Potential-Energy-Harvester
Our challenge was to design a scaled, proof-of-concept prototype for water energy conversion. Our prototype should propel our vehicle by converting the potential energy of water that we had to manually load into our device. Using that water as the power to propel our vehicle, our goal was to transport the water and unload as much water with our remotely controlled vehicle to a water delivery area in 15 minutes.
Solution:-
We tried to use the water weight to push a container made of acrylic sheet down a sliding ram. We connected the sliding container with a gear drive using a belt and pulley and converted the translation motion into rotational motion. We then used gear multiplication to increase the number of rotations of the wheel and hence get a desirable range. We used lightweight material and wheels of bigger diameter and used Arduino and servo motors for the steering and used simple rechargeable batteries.
Finally, we crossed all the preliminary steps, made the final submission, and achieved a Global Rank of 8th representing NIT Silchar as Team Four Squared.
